The project involved developing a web scraper that extracts data, including images and text, from a given webpage and compiles it into a Word document. Technologies such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Selenium were utilized to extract data from the webpage, and robust error handling and logging mechanisms were implemented to ensure the web scraper runs smoothly and effectively. The final output is a Word document that contains the extracted images and text from the webpage. The project was presented to faculty members and peers, showcasing exceptional communication and presentation skills. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
